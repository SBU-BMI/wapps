More below about [what a wApp is](#wapps-all-you-need-is-a-manifest). For those in a hurry let's go straight to the wapps developed here:

#wApps: all you need is a manifest
----
A **wApp** is a web application in a hurry to be part of a webApp ecosystem. All that this integration requires is the definition of a [manifest file](#manifest) where the wApps are identified. This file can be placed anywhere your browser can see and you can control. Using Dropbox or Google drive to share your manifests is quite alright. The wApps ecosystem can then be invoked with the parameter **manifest** and the multiple wApps identified will be integrated as part of a single web application. This github repository maintains the root manifest which is used by default when no manifest is specified. If you want your wApps to be added to those already specified in another manifest you would then use the parameter **addmanifest** instead. For convinience and security, the wApps application itself is kept and developped at [wapps.googlecode.com](http://wapps.googlecode.com), where it enjoys the protection of SSL serving. In order to make the most of GitHub's outstanding social coding features, the root manifest is kept here. If serving wApps through https is not important to you, you can also use [wapps.github.com](http://wapps.github.com)

In a nutshell, all you need is to concatenate your manifest URL with 
[https://wapps.googlecode.com/git/index.html?manifest=< URL of your manifest >](https://wapps.googlecode.com/git/index.html). Of course these long links are often best served through shortened services, try, for example, [https://bit.ly/w-apps](https://bit.ly/w-apps).

###Parameters
* **manifest**: URL of the primary manifest. If none is specified, then the one kept in this github repository,[https://raw.github.com/wApps/manifest/master/manifest.js](),will be used. In other words, [https://wapps.googlecode.com/git/index.html]() is equivalent to [https://wapps.googlecode.com/git/index.html?manifest=https://raw.github.com/wApps/manifest/master/manifest.js]().
* **addmanifest**: URL of the secondary manifest. The new wApps will be added to the ones defined in the primary manifest, if they are new (if they don't have a name already in use). The secondary manifest is particularly handy when developing a new wApp. It is also a convenient way to tailor the creation of new 
* **loadApps**: comma separated list of wApps to be automatically activated and displayed under "myApps". For example, [http://wapps.github.com?loadApps=ET callHome,someWApp](), or the https hosted equivalent, [https://wapps.googlecode.com/git/index.html?loadApps=ET callHome,someWApp](). 

### Manifest
This is the only file an wApps ecosystem needs to maintain. It includes four sections: 1) Branding, 2) Tabs, 3) Apps, and 4) Authors. The configuration is straight forward and it is best undertood by inspecting an existing manifest, such as the [root manifest](https://github.com/wApps/manifest/blob/master/manifest.js) maintained in this github repository. 

As the inspection of this file will reveal, the manifest is a JavaScript file, and each app will use a .builUI(id) method that assembles the wApp's UI within a DOM element with that id:

<code>
	
	wApps.manifest.apps.push(
		{ … descritpion of a wApp …},
		{ … descritpion of another wApp …},
		
		// now your wApp
		
		{ 
			"name": "name of your wApp",
    		"description": "description of your wApp to be shown in the wApp listing in the app Store",
    		"url": "URL of page descring you wApp",  
    		"author":"your name", //it should match the author name in the author list",
    		"namespace":"myVar",  // name of the variable, if any, that will be created by your script
    		buildUI:function(id){
        		this.require("URL of your script'",   // loaded only if namespace var not there already
            		function(){
            		    myVar.myUI(id);      //  your method to assemble UI at the element with given id
                	}
            	);
            	// or any other code you want to run
            }
        },
		
		{ … descritpion of another wApp etc …},
	)
</code>

The processing of the manifest object by the wApps application, [wApps.js](https://code.google.com/p/wapps/source/browse/wApps.js), adds a this.require method, which will load code from a URL before moving on to the UI assembly. The remote code loading is only triggered if the object specified by this.namespace is not already there. If it is, wApps proceeds directly to UI assembly. The only namespaces taken by the wApps ecosystem, besides "wApps", are those created by jQuery and twitter bootstrap (what is it?). 

If you have a wApp that is of general interest and want to added it to the root manifest, you are welcome to add it to add it here as a pull request.

### Security and trust
Because they are executed in a shared DOM space, wApps are an experiment in social coding. Each manifest defines a community of developers that trusts each other. Hacking information from one wApp by another can be avoided by using iframes, as illustrated in the root manifest. However, to some extent, that also defeats the purpose of the wApps ecosystem, where analytical workflows can be assembled with great flexibility by combining contributions from multiple wApps. An interesting balance between these two situations that does not fully expose an wApp is to use iframes with event listeners. Either way, striking the righ balance between flexibility and security is entirely left to the developer, who gets define the *.buildUI* function.

### Integration
The wApp ecosystem can itself be assembled anywhere in the web page. Like a wApp, the wApps ecosystem is assembled by a .buildUI function, so <code> wApps.buildUI(yourDesiredElementID)</code> will place it where you need it.

<code>
	
	<script src="http://wapps.googlecode.com/git/wApps.js"></script>
	<div id="lala"></div>
	<script>
		wApps.build("lala");
	</script>

And you can, like any individual wApp, always invoke it within the safety of an iframe:

<code> 

	<iframe width=100% height=800 seamless src="https://wapps.googlecode.com/git/index.html"></iframe> 
as right here (you'll see the embeded wApps ecosystem if you are reading this .md file from a Markdown editor like [Mou](http://mouapp.com/)):
<iframe width=100% height=800 seamless src="https://wapps.googlecode.com/git/index.html"></iframe>
